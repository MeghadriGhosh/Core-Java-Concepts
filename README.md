# Core-Java-Concepts
Here are examples of Java programs that demonstrate knowledge of Core Java concepts, including data structures and algorithms as well as object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

Demonstrate Knowledge of Core Java:

# 1. Data Structures & Algorithms:
   Include examples of different algorithms (sorting, searching) and implementations of data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees).

a) Sorting Algorithm - Merge Sort:

This program implements the Merge Sort algorithm, which is a classic divide-and-conquer sorting technique. The array is recursively divided into two halves, sorted individually, and then merged back together. This demonstrates recursion, efficient sorting, and array manipulation.

b) Data Structure - Stack Implementation using Arrays:

The stack is implemented using an array, with basic operations like push(), pop(), and peek(). It also checks for stack overflow and underflow conditions. This demonstrates understanding of stacks, a fundamental data structure often used in algorithmic challenges.

# 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
   Create projects that highlight OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

Key Points:

Encapsulation: The name attribute in the Animal class is private and accessed through getter methods.
Abstraction: The Animal class is abstract, meaning it cannot be instantiated and is designed to be extended by specific animals.
Inheritance: Both Dog and Cat extend from Animal, inheriting its properties and behaviors.
Polymorphism: The sound() method is overridden in the subclasses, demonstrating polymorphism where different animals make different sounds.

Overall, these code examples illustrate foundational knowledge in sorting algorithms, data structures, and key OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation, all of which are essential for Java development.
