# Core-Java-Concepts
Here are examples of Java programs that demonstrate knowledge of Core Java concepts, including data structures and algorithms as well as object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

Demonstrate Knowledge of Core Java:

# 1. Data Structures & Algorithms:
   Include examples of different algorithms (sorting, searching) and implementations of data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees).

# 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
   Create projects that highlight OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
